				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This is a p5.js project that uses ml5.js to track the user's hands, specifically their index fingers and thumbs. On the screen there will be a generated magnet that users can grab by pinching it, afterwhich they may move the magnet around. Whilst moving the magnet, music will be played and the colour of the magnet will change, making the experience reminiscent of being a music conductor.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This experiment tracks the user's hands via the HandPose model provided by ml5.js, meanwhile a custom Magnet class was used for the magnets the user can interact with. The program then tracks the user's fingertips and checks to see if they are pinching a magnet. If they are, the magnet will move to wherever the user's fingers go, giving the impression that they are moving the magnet. Additionally, whilst this is happening, different piano keys will play. The piano key sound that is played is determined by the magnet's current position on-screen. Furthermore, the pan and volume levels are also determined by this value. Thus, by dragging the magnet around, the user can effectively conduct their own music.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Like the other experiments, I worked solo on this project. This experiment actually marked the first time I have worked with a Machine Learning model. From my experience, the model appears to be very consistent though there are cases where it can mess up in terms of its accuracy. Nonetheless, I feel that I was able to successfully incorporate the model so that users can affect what is produced by the program simply by using their video cameras, meaning that no inputs via the mouse or keyboard were necessary.</p>
