				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this project is to generate a 3D structure using p5.js whilst giving users the opportunity to interact with it. As such, the generated structure in this experiment is a colourful tree where the user can adjust the leaves' size and shape by moving their mouse. They can also reverse the rotation by left clicking.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In order to generate this 3D element, a sine wave structure was used. This allowed for the creation of waves that oscillate depending on the canvas's current frame. These values are calculated and adjusted using p5.js's built-in functions to generate a 2D image with the illusion of it being 3D. Camera manipulation was also used to enhance the 3D effect and give the structure a spinning motion.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked alone to produce this experiment and it was through this project that I received exposure to using angles to generate wave-like patterns as well as manipulating the camera to create animations and 3D effects. There were no major issues with this project and a lot of features were figured out using trial and error with a sine wave tutorial as a basis.</p>
