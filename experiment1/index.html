				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>As this was my first ever attempt at using p5.js as an art design tool, my goal with this experiment was to create an artwork that utilised some basic funtionalities of p5.js so that I may become more familiar with the tool. I approached this experiment by looking at several art and shape references featured on the <a href="http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/">Generative Design website</a>. The artworks that stood out to me were the ones that adjusted in size and colour depending on the mouse's current position on screen. As a result, I decided to make an artwork that combines the different artworks I found inspirational and use them to create something entirely new albeit with similar interactive features.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>All of the interactive features of this experiment revolve around the mouse, specifically where the mouse is currently on screen and whether or not it has been clicked. For the mouse's position specifically, I utilised the canvas's ability to acquire the mouse's x and y coordinates and used those as inputs for the generated shapes' size, position, and colour. This allowed the artwork to change wherever the mouse was. Furthermore, I added a feature that determines if the mouse is currently over the canvas and will only perform certain interactions if so. This allowed my artwork to only come to life whenever the user was interacting with it.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As the only one who worked on this experiment, I spent most of the time reading through the code of other p5.js files and determining what each line did before adding my own inputs. The most difficult aspect of this experiment was of course determining what each line of code did and properly combining different unique features all at once. However, after conducting a bit of trial and error with the help of some debugging, I was able to implement the aspects I originally set out to make and produce an experience that combines the different inspirations I took from the Generative Design site.</p>
