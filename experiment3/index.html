				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experiment is to generate an artwork that makes use of both the camera and microphone. As a result, this experiment redraws what the camera captures using lines and curves. Furthermore, the lines will only be generated if the user produces noise. If the optimal noise value is met, then the artwork will be generated, and the louder the noise is, the faster it will generate. However, if the user becomes too loud, then the program will end and erase all of its data. This results in a generative art program that somewhat acts like a game where the user will have to move and make noise in order to produce the artwork that they desire.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In order to implement the camera aspect, I had to utilise some of p5.js's camera features and interate through what is gathered to generate the lines for the artwork. As for the audio, I simply used p5.js's audio input features to acquire the user's audio levels. These levels then act as a variable to determine whether or not the program should run and what behaviours it will have.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Whilst I am satisfied with the final output of this experiment, I unfortunately wasn't able to properly incorporate the second project that I chose to imitate for this experiment. This is because that project involved image manipulation, which this project doesn't use. Moreover, the generate artwork heavily revolves around the lines and curves it produces, and trying to incorporate any other types of designs would get in the way of the final artwork, meaning that I was somewhat limited in what drawing features I could implement. However, this did give me some experience with how sensitive p5.js can be when drawing things onto the canvas, and I will hopefully be more aware of it in the future. Nonetheless, I feel that not only have I made a program that generates art using both the camera and microphone, but I also made a game out of it, resulting in a unique and fun user experience.</p>
