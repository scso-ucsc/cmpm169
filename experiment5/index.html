				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experiment was to be able to generate ASCII art on a live video feed, resulting in a project that acts similar to that of a camera filter. However, for this experiment, I wanted to be able to go beyond a standard ASCII artwork generator and add dynamic features that are not traditionally seen in ASCII art. As a result, this project also features a pulsing colour scheme, a dyanmic array of ASCII characters that change over time, and multiple generations of the same ASCII layer to create a 3D effect. The result should be a colour and energetic piece of ASCII art that the user can interact with through their camera.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project works by first acquiring a live feed from a video camera. After that, the video is iterated through pixel by pixel and a specific ASCII character is chosen to represent that pixel in the artwork depending on how dark that pixel is. If the pixel is too bright, then no character will be generated, resulting in mostly only key features being included in the artwork. After the entire artwork is drawn, a second layer of this ASCII art is produced but with a bit of displacement and different colour scheme, supposedly creating a 3D effect. The ASCII text also changes in colour and variety through pulses that occur in intervals. The feature is automatic and the user does not need to do anything for this effect to occur.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Like the other experiments, I worked solo on this project and was in charge of conducting my own research and experimentation to create the final program featured here. I am mostly pleased with the result as I have never done anything like this before in p5.js. This project has also given me some great insights as to how to use live feed as an argument for an artwork as well as how ASCII art works in general. The only problem with such a project is that there isn't much to be able to innovate after making a program that produces a main artwork, so I struggled to come up with something truly original. However, I would argue that all of the subsequent dynamic features that I added to this artwork should suffice in creating a generative artwork that takes an additional step beyond your traditional ASCII art.</p>
