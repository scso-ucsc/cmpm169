				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>A habit tracker represented through the Ring of Time. This data visualization tool allows users to determine what days of the year they performed a specific activity and even notes down whenever streaks occur. Users may also hover over specific dates to properly determine which date they performed this activity.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>This project iterates through a CSV file consisting of both the month and day in which the activity occured at. The program takes those values and creates a Ring of Time structure, highlighting the exact days in which the activity occured via a blue box. The blue box becomes more vibrant and spins faster if there are any consecutive dates, resulting in a much more stunning visual. The program also tracks the user's mouse to determine if they are hovering over a particular date and shows the exact date of which the activity occurred in a readable manner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this project alone and was in charge of finding code to use as reference in order to properly implement this visual. Whilst ultimately not very complex, I believe that this project succeeded in achieving its goal of being a means for self surveilance and has the potential to be used for tracking users' healthy habits and reward them with a stunning visual they may show off to their friends or family.</p>
